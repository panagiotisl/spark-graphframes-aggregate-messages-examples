"""
Simple example using aggregateMessages.

The goal is to find the minimum rating of a player (node) by sending the neighbors
the currently known minimum rating by each node.

Run with: ~/spark-2.4.7-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/spark-submit --packages graphframes:graphframes:0.7.0-spark2.3-s_2.11  /vagrant/example.py
